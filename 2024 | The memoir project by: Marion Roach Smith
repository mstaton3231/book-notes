Write what you know

Write what you fear / write what scares you
mls: some things that scare me are failure, being a fool, being ignored, not respected or not respectable, to be found out as one not having integrity, being betrayed, my child or grandchild growing up in a hard world and not being prepared, losing family, losing respect, being ashamed. I am afraid of being one of those people in the nursing home that we used to visit - lonely, warehoused. I'm afraid of being worthless and useless and having no value in the world and having nothing to offer. Afraid of not being smart emough to understand the world around me.

We are all afraid at the margins of our roles (for me, husband, dad, grandad, son, brother)

if you are writing about your 8-year-old self then write from the perspective of an 8-year-old, using only 8-year-old concepts and language.  Do not quote any movies do not bring in pop culture awareness and do not bring in the later inside of your teenage self. Maybe this perspective will help you understand something that has been puzzling you.
