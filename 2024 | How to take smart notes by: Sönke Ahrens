workflow is key - our willpower is limited and depletes 
workflow is what produces ongoing, steady, sustainable results
don't have to work to store everyhting in your head 

False dichotomy: either you force a plan on having insight or you aimlessly wander about
Middle way: workflow, process, structure that you work in, not that you impose on yourself

He describes the good students who spend the time in the library and who struggle to express ideas well because they know it matters - not taking the easy road out

good students peek over the fences of their disciplines, even though there are no manuals for how to fit all the heterogeneous (I would say inter-disciplinary) pieces together 

really interesting - my struggle with choosing to be the small fish in the big pond is being touched on here - 
poor students are happy to live in a dunning-kruger overconfidence 

good students know there is too much info out there - imposter syndrome versus dunning-kruger 

** something to look up: sull and eisenhardt 2015, simplicity of structure allows you to add complexity where needed

Getting things done by david allen is about the workflow, the process
holistic perspective: everything needs to be taken care of
Allen more popular in business than academia due to it doesn't translate well in the specifics but the holistic perspective and the process and workflow still are just as useful and helpful

(this book is really inspiring me!!)

The conveyor belt might have seemed like a simple, small change to Henry Ford's contemporaries. Simple ideas that scale up can be surprisingly powerful in their results. 

You can add the same note to different contexts, due to linking

Writing something down helps you remember it
writing something in your own words helps you think about it and understand it
